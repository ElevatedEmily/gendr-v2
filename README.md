This is a genderqueer dating app called gendr. It is a fullstack app that uses sqlite and prisma for the database; typescript, reactjs, and tailwindcss for the frontend; and nextjs for the backend.

## Getting Started

install code base 
```bash
git clone  https://github.com/ElevatedEmily/gendr-v2.git
```

install dependencies
```bash
 npm install nextauth bcrypt prisma path fs react-icons framer-motion tailwindcss next react-slick --legacy-peer-deps

```
set up the database

```bash
npx prisma migrate dev --name init
```

run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.
